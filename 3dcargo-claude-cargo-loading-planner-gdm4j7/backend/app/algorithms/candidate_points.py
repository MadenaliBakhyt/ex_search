"""Candidate placement points.

Instead of scanning every integer coordinate in the truck volume, we only
ever consider a small, growing set of "candidate points" — corners exposed
by items already placed (plus the origin). This is the standard technique
used by corner-point / extreme-point 3D bin packing heuristics and keeps the
algorithm fast even with thousands of items.

        first, then lowest X (closest to the front), then lowest Y (closest
        to the left wall). Prioritizing X before Y means the packer fills a
        row across the truck's *width* at the current front position before
        it ever advances further down the *length* -- matching how cargo is
        loaded in practice (side by side across the trailer, row by row down
        its length) instead of hugging one wall in a single line the full
        length of the truck before ever using the rest of the width.

        With prefer_stacking, Z is inverted (highest first): the top of an
        already-started stack always outranks an empty floor spot, so the
        packer builds one column as tall as stacking rules allow before
        starting a new footprint -- instead of covering the floor in a
        single layer first. Only ever matters for cargo that's actually
        stackable; it changes candidate *order*, not which placements are
        valid, so per-item stacking rules (max tiers/height/top load,
        fragile) are unaffected.
